# Avant Launches New 'Tracker' Variable Rate


## 24 Mar 2025


Avant Money, has introduced a new variable-rate mortgage product tracked against a key eurozone lending rate.

The new "Flex Mortgage" is directly linked to the 12-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), which represents the average interest rate at which European banks lend money to one another and serves as a benchmark for various financial products.

Avant Money adds a fixed margin to the Euribor rate, which varies based on the customer's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio:

| Product | Benchmark Rate (Euribor) | Margin | Customer Rate |
| :--- | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| <80% LTV | 2.41% | 0.90% | 3.31% |
| >80% LTV | 2.41% | 1.10% | 3.51% |
