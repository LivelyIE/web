# Finance Ireland Exits Irish Mortgage Market

## 26 Mar 2025

Finance Ireland has announced its withdrawal from the mortgage lending space. Finance Ireland has struggled in an environment where European interest rates are not at historic lows and have offered relatively unattractive interest rates in recent years. 

Current mortgage holders will have their loans transferred to Pepper Advantage.

While having one less lender in the market isn't ideal for Irish consumers, newer lenders continue to innovate and there are signs of more lenders entering the market in the coming years, including Revolut.

Finance Ireland said that they have experienced significant price competition from the three Irish banks which _“benefit enormously from cheap funding at the expense of their deposit account holders”_.
