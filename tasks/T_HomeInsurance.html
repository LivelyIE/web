    <p>Your lender will not approve your mortgage until you have organised home insurance for your new home.
        Your solicitor will work with the seller to determine an estimated date on when the sale will close and 
        you should organise to have your insurance start on the same day. If this date moves, you can also change it with your insurer. 
    </p>

    <p>While sometimes convenient, there is no obligation to take out home insurance with your lender.
        Your lender will often have a discount for insurance products, but prices can vary dramatically so it's worth shopping around.
    </p>

    <p>Not having insurance in place is a common cause of delays with property purchases. 
        Be sure to start looking as soon as you are sale agreed on a home.
