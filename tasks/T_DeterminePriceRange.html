    <p>With knowledge of how much you might be able to borrow and the costs involved in purchasing a home, 
        you can now determine your price range. It's often a good idea to have separate budgets for different scenarios. 
        For example, your price range for a new home may be higher than that for a home you'll need to pay to renovate.

    <p>It's important to understand that just because a lender is willing to lend you a certain amount, 
        there's no obligation for you to use it entirely. Try to factor in how your lifestyle fits in with 
        your mortgage repayments. Consider your flexibility to be without work for a period of time 
        or the cost of a growing family.
