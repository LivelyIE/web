    <p>To keep up to date with new homes that come on the market, popular house hunting websites allow you to configure email alerts on 
        new listings matching your criteria. It's worth configuring these on more than one website, as properties don't always list on every platform. 
    </p>
    <p>For locations you are interested in, consider adding adjacent towns and regions to your search as some properties may not have an address you expect. 
        This may also let you find properties that aren't on the radar of other buyers.
