    <p>While in some cases you are required to contact the estate agent beforehand, most of the time you don't need to register for a viewing and can simply turn up.
        If a property you are interested in does not have an upcoming viewing mentioned, don't hesitate to reach out to the estate agent.
    </p>
    <p>Try to view many properties in the areas and price ranges you're targeting and ask about current bids. This will build up your understanding of the current market.

    <h3>How do I keep track of viewings?</h3>
    <p>Keeping track of viewings you would like to attend can be difficult. One way to approach it is to have a spreadsheet or a document handy where you can 
        jot down viewing times and addresses, roughly ordered by when viewings take place. Organising your viewings like this means you'll be able to visit multiple homes in a day
        and it will help you prioritise where to focus your time.
    </p>
    <p>Another benefit of having a spreadsheet is that you have somewhere to easily keep track of notes about properties you have visited.
