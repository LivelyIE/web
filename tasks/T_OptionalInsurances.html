    <p>Other than mortgage protection insurance and home insurance, you will come across insurance products that are not legally required but may be useful to you.
    </p>
    <p>While insurers will provide you with honest advice on what your options are, it's important to note that generally 
        they will receive commission on insurance products you purchase.

    <h3>Critical Illness Cover</h3>
    <p>Critical illness cover, or "serious illness" cover, is an optional addition to your mortgage protection
        policy whereby you will be payed a lump sum in the case that you develop a serious illness. You should read your
        policy carefully, and understand exactly which illnesses are covered as not all insurers are the same.
    </p>

    <h3>Income Protection Insurance</h3>
    <p>Income protection insurance provides you with a regular cash payment in case you canâ€™t work due to an illness or disability. 
        Policies for this type of insurance vary dramatically, so be sure to understand the terms before you agree to a policy. 
    </p>
    <p>This type of insurance can be particularly valuable for individuals who are self-employed, or who work in
        industries with associated physical demand. Those working in particularly risky careers may be refused entirely.
