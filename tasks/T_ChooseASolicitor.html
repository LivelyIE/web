    <p>The type of solicitor you will need to take care of the legalities of buying a home is known as a <i>Conveyancing</i> solicitor. 
        You should begin searching for one as soon as you start looking for a home.
    </p>

    <p>Ask family and friends if they can recommend someone and search online for a solicitor in your local area. 
        You may need to meet with them in person just once to sign the the contracts, the rest can happen over phone and email, 
        but it's convenient to hire one that is close to your home or place of work.
    </p>

    <p>When searching for a solicitor, be sure to ask around and get itemised quotes before making a final decision. 
        Most of the fees will be fixed and vary very little per quote. The <i>Professional Fee</i> is usually the name of the 
        fee payed to your conveyancer for their services.
    </p>

    <p>You generally won't incur any costs until you are sale agreed on a property.
        If the sale falls through, you may still need to pay your solicitor for their services and any fees they payed on your behalf. 
        This will depend on how far through the process you are.
    </p>

    <h4>How long does the process take once I am sale agreed?</h4>
    <p>The conveyancing process generally takes 6-8 weeks, although it's not uncommon to experience delays.
