    <p>A fixed rate mortgage means you will accumulate interest due on your loan at a fixed rate for a number of years, usually anywhere between 3 and 7 years.
        This means that your monthly repayments will remain the same for the length of your fixed term contract.
    </p>

    <p>A variable rate means your interest rate is influenced by economic conditions and is subject to change at the discretion of the bank.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the key considerations when making your decision:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed rate mortgages provide more stability and peace of mind. You won't need to consider interest rates until your fixed term expires.</li>
        <li>Typically on fixed rate mortgages, you will not be able to pay back lump sums of your loan without incurring a fee. 
            With variable rate loans, you are free to repay lump sums or overpay on a monthly basis at your leisure. 
            This flexibility allows you to reduce your monthly payments or shorten your mortgage length. 
        </li>
        <li>Fixed rate loans allow you to lock in a lower interest rate in a market where interest rates are likely to rise. Likewise, variable rate loans allow 
            you to take advantage of lower interest when interest rates are falling.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How does the interest rate impact my repayments?</h3>
    <p>When deciding on a lender, the interest rate offered should be your main consideration. The total interest payed on your loan is known as the <i>Cost of Credit</i>. 
        Small changes to your yearly interest rate can have a significant impact on your cost of credit over a long period of time.
    </p>
    <p>The following table illustrates the cost of credit on a €300,000 loan over the course of 30 years with different interest rates.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Interest Rate</th>
            <th>Monthly Repayment</th>
            <th>Cost of Credit</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3%</td>
            <td>€1,264.81</td>
            <td>€155,332.36</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.5%</td>
            <td>€1,347.13</td>
            <td>€184,968.26</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4%</td>
            <td>€1,432.25</td>
            <td>€215,608.52</td>
          </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In this example, a rate difference of 1% means paying an additional €60,276 in interest over the course of the mortgage.</p>

    <h3>What happens when my fixed rate period ends?</h3>
    <p>When your fixed period ends, you are free to reevaluate the market and sign a new fixed or variable rate contract. You can even move your mortgage to a different bank.
        If you have been saving during your fixed rate, you can pay off a lump sum without incurring fees and then begin a new fixed term contract.
