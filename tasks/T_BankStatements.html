    <p>Your lender will request bank statements for the previous six months. Not only will you need bank statements from your primary bank account, 
        but you will likely need to submit records for other bank accounts you may have such as <i>Revolut</i>. 
        Your bank may follow up with questions on large transactions in your statements.  
    </p>
    <h3>What are lenders looking for in my transaction history?</h3>
    <p>Lenders review your bank statements to ensure you are responsible with your money, that you are saving regularly and are able to meet your financial obligations on time without
        frequently availing of overdrafts.
        They will also verify that you have not misled them with details of your application. One example of this is payments for a loan that you have not disclosed.
        The number one thing a lender wants to see is consistency in your savings and financial obligations over time. 
    </p>

    <p>In the case of a single individual applying for a mortgage, they will verify that there aren't a significant amount of transactions to a potential partner
        that would imply shared financial responsibilities or that your partner is dependant on your income. If this is the case, you will need to declare it to any
        potential lenders so that they can factor it into your application.

    <h3>Will gambling activity affect my application?</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, a small amount gambling is not going to disqualify you for a mortgage. While it is advised that gambling should be avoided in the run up
        to your application, as long as you are putting aside regular savings and gambling doesn't impact your ability to pay your bills it should not be a red flag. 
    </p>
    <h3>Will investments affect my application?</h3>
    <p>
        Frequently contributing to safer long-term investments won't be a concern for lenders.
        While the policy varies by lender, short term investments in assets like cryptocurrencies and certain stocks can be seen as a form of gambling
        and is best avoided in the lead up to applying for a loan. If you do invest in riskier assets make sure it's with your disposable income and that you
        are not dipping in to your regular savings.
