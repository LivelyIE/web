    <p>Your lender will request bank statements for the previous six months. Not only will you need bank statements from your primary bank account, 
        but you will likely need to submit records for other bank accounts you may have such as <i>Revolut</i>. 
        Your bank may follow up with questions on large transactions in your statements.  
    </p>
    <h3>What are lenders looking for in my transaction history?</h3>
    <p>Lenders review your bank statements to ensure you are responsible with your money, that you are saving regularly and are able to meet your financial obligations on time without
        frequently availing of overdrafts.
        They will also verify that you have not misled them with details of your application. One example of this is payments for a loan that you have not disclosed.
    </p>

    <p>In the case of a single individual applying for a mortgage, they will verify that there aren't a significant amount of transactions to a potential partner
        that would imply shared financial responsibilities or that your partner is dependant on your income. If this is the case, you will need to declare it to any
        potential lenders so that they can factor it into your application. 
    </p>

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, gambling is not going to disqualify you for a mortgage. As long as you are putting aside regular savings and gambling
        doesn't impact your ability to pay your bills, this should not be a red flag.
