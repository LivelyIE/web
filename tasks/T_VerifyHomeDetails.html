    <p>Your solicitor won't inspect your home in person and will need to work with you to verify that the official records of the home
        match the physical property.
    </p>
        
    <p>They may ask you to confirm on a map that the home boundaries are what you expect, and they will ask you about 
        modifications to the property to verify that they match approved planning applications. Your surveyor's report will be
        helpful here.
