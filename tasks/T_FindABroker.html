    <p>A mortgage broker is a professional who deeply understands the ins and outs of the mortgage process and typically has a working relationship
        with numerous lenders. 
    </p>

    <p>While a broker is not required, here are some reasons you might consider working with one:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Advice</b> - A broker will be able to provide advice specific to your situation.</li>
        <li><b>Saving Time</b> - Working with lenders for mortgage approval can take a lot of time and effort. 
            A broker can communicate on your behalf with multiple lenders as well as work directly with your solicitor.</li>
        <li><b>Quicker Turnaround</b> - Your broker will catch issues with your application before they are sent to the bank.</li>
        <li><b>Limit Exceptions</b> - If you're looking for an exception to the typical borrowing limits, your broker will know which lenders
            are able to offer you exceptions and help set your application up for success.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Broker Fees</h2>
    <p>Some brokers charge you directly, though it is increasingly common for brokers to take their fee from commission they earn from lenders and insurance providers 
        received for signing you up as a customer. Using a broker will not increase the cost of these products.
