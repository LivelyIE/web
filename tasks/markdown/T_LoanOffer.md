Your lender will send you and your solicitor a copy of your *Loan Offer*. This is a set of documents that 
 outlines the terms and conditions of your mortgage. Your solicitor will review these documents with you 
 to make sure you understand and agree with the conditions laid out.
 
Once you are satisfied you will sign these documents and your solicitor will return a signed copy to the lender. 

## Interest Rate Changes

Even though your loan offer will be valid for six months it typically won't guarantee a specific interest rate. Interests rates can change right up until drawdown and when they change lenders usually offer a grace period of a few weeks to drawdown before the new rate is applied.
