It is common for a relative to gift a lump sum to contribute to a house deposit, refurbishments or other costs of buying a home. 
 When this occurs, your lender needs to verify that the deposit into your account is not an additional debt that may impact your ability to repay your mortgage. 
 


Any gifts will require an accompanying signed letter from the sender that outlines the following:


* The gift amount.
* Their relationship with the receiver of the gift.
* A statement that the gift is non-returnable and that the sender waives all interest in the property.


## Tax Implications of Gifts


During a calendar year any individual can gift up to €3,000 to another. This means that *each parent* could theoretically 
 gift €3,000 to their child and their child’s partner for a total of €12,000 without triggering any tax obligations. 
 


After the yearly allowance, you may be required to pay *Capital Acquisitions Tax* (CAT) if the gift exceeds a certain threshold.
 CAT is charged to the receiver of the gift and is calculated as a total of all gift amounts from the 5th of December, 1991. 
 


In the most common scenario, whereby a parent gifts a child a lump sum, there is a lifetime tax free threshold of €335,000.


For other direct relatives such as a sibling or niece, the allowance is €32,500. For anyone else, the allowance is €16,250.


## Interest-Free Loans from Relatives


To avoid eating into the lifetime gift allowance parents will sometimes lend their child money without a set repayment date or an expectation 
 of interest to be paid. If the loan is not repaid before the parents pass away the remaining unpaid loan amount is written off and 
 considered as part of the child's total inheritance amount.
 
Both Revenue and your lender will require the terms of the loan in a contract and signed by all parties involved. Your lender may also ask you to 
 create a “Deed of Confirmation” with your parents. This legal document will state that the bank has precedence to the property in 
 case legal or financial issues arise in future.
