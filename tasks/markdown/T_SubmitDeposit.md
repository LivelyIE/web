Around the same time you sign the contracts you will need to send the deposit to your solicitor.
 The amount will be 10% if you are a first time buyer, minus the *booking deposit* you transferred previously.
 Your solicitor will then send this to the seller if everything is in order. 
 

### Beware of Scams
There have been instances of scammers gaining access to conversations between buyers and solicitors where the buyer is sent an email containing instructions to transfer their deposit to the scammer's bank account. If there is any doubt about the transfer instructions from your solicitor, call them to confirm the details using a phone number from their website or on document they have previously sent. You can also send your solicitor â‚¬1 and ask them to be sure of the details.
