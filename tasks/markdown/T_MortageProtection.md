Mortgage Protection insurance is a type of life insurance that pays off your mortgage in the case that 
 one of the policy holders die.
 You will be required by law to take out mortgage protection insurance before your loan is approved.
 
Make sure to shop around as rates can vary significantly. You do not need to take out mortgage protection insurance with your lender.

It's important to search for mortgage protection early as not having it in place is a common cause of drawdown delays. Usually you can acquire it in a few days, however it can take weeks if you have any underlying health issues as you may need a letter from your doctor and insurers will need more time to evaluate your application.


### Reducing Term Cover vs Level Term Cover

When searching for mortgage protection insurance, you will come across the the phrases *reducing term*
 and *level term*. 
 
Reducing term means that the amount the policy covers will reduce over time. 
 For example, if you were to pass away after paying €150,000 on a €200,000 mortgage then the payout would be €50,000.
 Level term means that the coverage does not decrease over time, and in the previous example the payout would be the full €200,000. 
 
Reducing term is the cheapest and most common option for mortgage protection insurance.
