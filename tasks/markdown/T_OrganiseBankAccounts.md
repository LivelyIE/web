Your lender will look back through six months of your bank statements when applying for a mortgage so it's a good idea to clearly structure savings and expenses beforehand. Your lender will request statements for all bank accounts you have including those like *Revolut*. 


## Structure Your Savings

It's a good idea to open a separate account to save into. Many people have two savings accounts in the run up to their mortgage application - one purely for saving for their home and another for short-term savings goals like holidays, weddings, etc. Your lender will expect you to save consistently each month. Missing a month, reducing the saving amount or withdrawing from your savings could impact your application.


## Where to Keep Your Deposit

Keep your deposit wherever is connivent for you to regularly contribute to. You should also consider shopping around for a competitive deposit interest rate as some banks provide very little interest. If, for example, you earn 3% interest on €40,000 over a year you would have an extra €1,200 to go towards your new home!

If applying for a mortgage with a partner it is not an issue if you have separate savings accounts. 


## Overdrafts and Missed Payments

Lenders don't like to see when can't afford a bill or loan payment or when you need to use your overdraft. While one-off occurrences can sometimes be explained it's best to have an additional buffer in your current account to make sure you aren't missing any payments and demonstrating financial responsibility.
 

## Gambling

Contrary to popular belief, a small amount gambling is not going to disqualify you for a mortgage. While it is advised that gambling should be avoided in the run up to your application, as long as you are putting aside regular savings and gambling doesn't impact your ability to pay your bills it should not be a red flag. 
 

## Investments 

Frequently contributing to safe long-term investments won't be a concern for lenders.

Investing in assets like cryptocurrencies and high risk stocks can be seen as a form of gambling, though the policy varies by lender. It is best avoided in the lead up to your mortgage application however if you do invest, make sure it's with your disposable income and that you don't dip into your regular savings.

### Can I use investments as part of my deposit?

Yes, though of course you will need to sell the assets and you may need to prove to your lender that you have covered tax owed on any profits.
