## Your Buyer Profile

The amount you bid isn't the only factor estate agents and sellers consider when deciding on a purchaser. Here are some pieces of information you can use to make your bid more attractive:

### 1. Chains 
If you are bidding on a property but your offer is contingent upon the sale of your current home, then you are considered to be in a "chain." Buyers caught in a chain are more likely to introduce delays for sellers, therefore, if you are not part of a chain, make sure to communicate this to the estate agent.

### 2. Cash Buyers
Although rare, cash buyers will have an advantage over mortgage buyers as they will be able to close the sale much quicker. 

### 3. Tell Your Story

When bidding it might be worth your time to send a short note about your situation to the estate agent and ask them to pass it on to the seller. 
 When the seller is making their decision, it could help sway them in your favour even if your final bid is lower. 
 For example if you are a local to the area or have a young family the seller may be more inclined to accept your offer over an investor. 


## Bidding Tips

### Set a Limit

It's easy to get caught up in a bidding war, and after bidding "once more" too many times you can end up winning with a price you aren't comfortable with.
 Before your first bid, decide what your maximum price is for the property.


### Choose Your Increment Carefully

Typically estate agents accept bids in increments no smaller than â‚¬1,000. When bidding against potential buyers, sometimes increasing the bid by a few 
 thousand Euro can send strong signal to other buyers and deter them from outbidding you.


### Matching Bids

Matching bids is a great way to slow down or stop a bidding war. If you feel you have an advantage over another bidder you can match a bid or even undercut it and try to force a seller to choose between you. An estate agent is obliged to pass on all bids to the vendor. 

### Make the First Bid

In busy markets, many properties will sell above the asking price. If you feel like there will be a lot of interest in a home you are considering,
 an initial offer at or above the asking price can be a deterrent to other buyers. In quieter markets, the final price can be lower than the asking price
 and starting low is a viable option. 
 

### Show Proof of Funds

When you place a bid most estate agents will ask for proof that a lender has provided you with mortgage approval in principle. 
 If you don't want to show your hand by giving the estate agent your approval amount you can hide the figures or ask your lender/broker/solicitor to write a statement indicating 
 that you have approval for at least the amount of your bid.


### Set an Ultimatum

If you are the highest bidder and the seller is dragging their heels and waiting for further bids, it can be a good idea to let the estate agent know a date in the near future that you will be bidding on other properties. This could force the seller to accept your bid. However just because you are the highest bidder it does not mean that a seller is required to accept your offer and they may hold out for a price that they are willing to sell for. 


## How to Place a Bid

1. Talk to the estate agent at a viewing and begin to build a relationship with them.
2. Call the agent after the viewing and place your bid.
3. Follow up with your bid in writing over email. Be sure to include any additional information that could make your bid more attractive versus other buyers.
