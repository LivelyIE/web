A salary certificate will need to be requested from your employer. 
 Typically, the certificate will contain the following details:

* Your position in the company.
* Whether you are part time or full time.
* Whether you are permanent or a contractor.
* If you have completed your probationary period.
* Your guaranteed base salary.
* Details of any bonuses or commissions you are eligible for.
* Whether the position is in-office, remote or a hybrid. 


## Mortgage Approval and Probation

While a lender will grant you Approval in Principle during your probationary period, in most circumstances they will be very hesitant to let you drawdown until it is finished. If you think you will need to drawdown before the period has ended, talk to your employer about the possibility of reducing your probationary period or ask your lender(s) about your options.
