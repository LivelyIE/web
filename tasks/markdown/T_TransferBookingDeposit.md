Once your offer is accepted by the estate agent, the home is considered to be at the *Sale Agreed* stage. 
 You will need to transfer a *Booking Deposit* to the estate agent, a sum of money that signals to all parties that you intend to proceed
 with the purchase the property. 
 The size of the booking deposit is typically a percentage of the sale price, no more than 10%, or a fixed amount. 
 
By law, booking deposits are fully refundable if you decide not to go through with the sale for **any** reason.
