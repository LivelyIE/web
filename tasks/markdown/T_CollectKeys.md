Your solicitor will receive the loan amount from your lender and will transfer the balance of funds to the seller's solicitor, at which point
 the sale is complete and the estate agent will organise when and where to collect the keys. Congratulations!
 
Note that there may be some formalities remaining in registering you as the new property owner after you
 get the keys. This is normal and your solicitor will keep you informed.
