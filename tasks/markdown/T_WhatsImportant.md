It's easy to get wrapped up in the excitement of bidding on an amazing house without considering if it's really the right one for you.

Before you begin you begin your search, take note of what you *need* and what you *want*. 
 After all, you will likely be committing to your new home for many years.
 
Here are some factors you may want to consider:

* Commute time.
* Proximity to amenities.
* Garden size and aspect.
* Proximity to public transport.
* Condition of the home.
* Parking spots.
* Number of bedrooms.
* Local school options.


### Choosing Between an Apartment and a House

Pros of apartments:

* The maintenance effort is low as the management company will handle a lot and you won’t have a garden to worry about. 
* They are often well situated in areas with good amenities and public transport.
* Apartments are generally more affordable than houses. 

Cons of apartments:

* You are more likely to be frustrated by noise pollution with potential neighbours beside, above and below you. 
* If you have a bad management company you will need to pressure them to get things done.
* There is less storage space to work with as you won't have an attic or outdoor space.

A key difference between purchasing an apartment over a house is that you will need to pay yearly management fees to cover maintenance costs on the building. These can be €1,000 - €2,000 or much higher depending on the building.


### Additional Considerations for One-Bedroom Homes
Be careful about choosing a home with one bedroom as sometimes lenders will require a 20% deposit rather than 10%. Talk to your lender or broker before bidding on a one-bedroom home. Another concern with single bedroom homes is that you will not have the option to rent another bedroom if you need to.
