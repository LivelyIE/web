Your solicitor will verify that there are no outstanding taxes due on the property. One such tax is Local Property Tax (LPT). 
 LPT is paid to your local council yearly based on the valuation of your home. 
 The last time home values were set was in May 2013, with valuation changes occurring in November 2021 and every 4 years thereafter.

### Who is liable to pay LPT in the event of a sale?

The owner of the property on November 1st of a given year is responsible for the payment for the following year. 
 So if you own a home on November 1st 2021, you are responsible for paying the tax for 2022.


### What if my home is a new build

New homes will need to be registered for LPT every November starting in 2021.


### What if I believe the valuation is incorrect?

After the sale of the property, you can write to your local LPT branch to update the property valuation.
 

### How much is LPT?

It varies slightly for each local council in Ireland. For the Dublin City Council region, a home valued at €375,000 would pay €573 in 
 property tax and a home valued at €675,000 pays €1,032.
