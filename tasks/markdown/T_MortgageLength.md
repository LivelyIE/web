Deciding the length of your mortgage is a balance between your monthly repayments and the total interest you will pay on your loan.
 Increasing the length of your mortgage will spread your repayments out over a longer period of time while reducing your monthly payments, but you will also
 accrue more interest.
 


Here is an illustration of how different mortgage lengths impact your monthly payments and total *Cost of Credit*. This example is for a €300,000 loan with a 3% interest rate.




| Mortgage Length | Monthly Repayment | Cost of Credit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25 Years | €1,422.63 | €126,790.18 |
| 30 Years | €1,264.81 | €155,332.36 |
| 35 Years | €1,154.55 | €184,911.24 |


As you can see, opting for a higher monthly repayment to shorten your mortgage length can save you a significant amount of money.


### How long can my mortgage last?


The maximum length of your mortgage will depend on your age and overall health, with banks being more willing to extend the length of mortgages of younger people.
 Lenders in Ireland typically max out at 35 year mortgages.
