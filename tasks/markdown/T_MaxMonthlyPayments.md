While your income is an important indicator in how much you can borrow, your expenditure and ability to meet monthly repayments will also be closely looked at by lenders. 
 This is known as your *Repayment Capacity*. Favourable contributors to your repayment capacity include:
 * **Savings** - Planned savings that are made consistently on a monthly basis.
* **Rent Payments** - Note that lenders may not be able to factor in rent paid in cash without a receipt.
* **Disposable Income** - The amount remaining after savings and regular expenses.
* **Loan Repayments** - If you are making repayments on a loan that will end before you will finalise your mortgage, those payments can be included in this Calculation.
* **Pension Contributions** - Any voluntary pension contributions are considered as part of your repayment capacity as, in theory, they could be halted to contribute to mortgage repayments.

Regular expenses are considered against your repayment capacity:

* **Loan Repayments** - Those that do not expire before your mortgage will begin.
* **Children** - You will require additional disposable income at the end of the month for each child to factor in variable costs of childcare. 
 Depending on the bank, this can be roughly €250 and will decrease per child.

Your bank will combine these factors and "stress test" them to ensure that you will be able to manage a possible increase in interest rates.
 One way banks stress test your income is by testing it against a hypothetical 2% increase in interest rates. 
 

### Example Calculation


Imagine a couple saving a combined €1000 per month. They are paying €1400 in rent, and regularly have €50 in disposable income left after expenses.
 This would total €2450 that may contribute to mortgage repayments. Detracting an additional buffer of €250 for their child, they have €2200 remaining. 
 Lastly, they reduce the total by roughly 25% to mimic the bank's "stress test", estimating their maximum monthly payment at €1650.
