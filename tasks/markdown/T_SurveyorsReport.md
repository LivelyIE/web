A surveyors report, sometimes called an engineer's report, is an impartial review on the condition of a property.
 If purchasing a second hand home, it is highly recommended that you hire a professional surveyor to evaluate the property before you sign the contracts.

A surveyor will be looking closely for signs of defects with the home, such as dampness or damaged roofing. 
 

### What if they find a problem?

All homes require maintenance, and it is common for these reports to note minor concerns that shouldn't put you off your purchase. 
 In the case where a serious issue is uncovered, you have a few options:
 
* Proceed with the sale, accepting that you will need to address the problem.
* Renegotiate the purchase price to factor in the cost of repair work.
* Ask the current owners to take steps to resolve the problem.
* If the issue is too much to overcome, you may pull out of the sale.


## New Home Snag Lists

For new homes, you likely won't need a full structural report. Instead, you will compile a *Snag List* which will consist of a list of defects that need 
 to be addressed by the builders of the property before the sale is finalised. Items in a snag list can be anything from a broken plug socket to an uneven surface. If you don't provide the developer with this list then you will be responsible for defects after the sale closes which can be costly and time consuming to repair.
