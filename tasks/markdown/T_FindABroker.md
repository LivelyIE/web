A mortgage broker is a professional who deeply understands the ins and outs of the mortgage process and typically has a working relationship
 with numerous lenders. 
 
While a broker is not required, here are some reasons you might consider working with one:

* **Exclusive Rates** - As you can see in the _Live Rates_ section of the app, some lenders work exclusively through brokers.
* **Advice** - A broker will be able to provide advice specific to your situation.
* **Time Saving** - Working with lenders for mortgage approval can take a lot of time and effort. 
 A broker can communicate on your behalf with multiple lenders as well as work directly with your solicitor.
* **Quicker Turnaround** - Your broker will catch issues with your application before they are sent to the bank.
* **Applying for Lending Exceptions** - If you're looking for an exception to the typical borrowing limits, your broker will know which lenders
 are able to offer you exceptions and help set your application up for success.


## Broker Fees

All brokers make commission from lenders and insurance providers for signing you up as a customer. Some brokers may also charge a fee for their services.
 Using a broker will not increase the cost of these products.
 
## When To Contact a Broker

If you choose to apply via a broker you should contact them at any time from six months away from your mortgage application right up to when you're ready to apply.
