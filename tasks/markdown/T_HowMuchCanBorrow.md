As a first time buyer, you cannot borrow more than 90% of the value of the home. This is known as the *Loan-To-Value* (LTV) ratio. This means if you have €30,000 for a home deposit as first time buyer you can borrow a maximum of €270,000 on top of that. 
 For second time or subsequent buyers, the LTV ratio is 80%.
 
The maximum amount you can borrow is typically 3.5 times the **pre-tax** income of you, or you and your partner if making a joint application.

### How can I get an exception to the typical borrowing limits?

A percentage of mortgage loans granted by a bank can be above the 3.5x income limit to raise the borrowing limit up to 4.5x or even 5x income for strong applications. 
 You will need to be able to show your bank that you are able to comfortably meet your monthly mortgage repayments if granted an exception.
 Generally, the later it is in the year the more difficult it is to acquire an exception as banks begin to use up their yearly allowance.
 Try the Lively in-app calculator to help determine if you might be eligible for an exception and discuss your situation with any lenders or brokers you approach. 
 

### How are bonuses and commission factored into my borrowing limit?

What banks consider your *variable income* are things like commission, bonuses and overtime pay. Depending on the lender,
 they will factor in 50% - 100% of this income by taking the average over the past 2 - 3 years. The longer you have been in the job,
 the more data they have and the more willing they are to take variable income into consideration. 
 

### Can I use investments as part of my deposit?

Yes, though of course you will need to sell the assets and you may need to prove to your lender that you have covered tax owed on any profits.
