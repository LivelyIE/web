## Based on Savings

You cannot borrow more than 90% of the value of the home. This is known as the *Loan-To-Value* (LTV) ratio. This means if you have a 10% deposit of €30,000  you can borrow a maximum of €270,000 on top of that. 

## Based on Income
 
The maximum amount you can borrow as a first time buyer is 4x times the **pre-tax** income of you, or you and your partner if making a joint application. For subsequent buyers the limit is 3.5x income.

### How can I get an exception to the typical borrowing limits?

A percentage of mortgage loans granted by a bank can be above the standard 3.5x/4x income limit. Exceptions allow buyers to raise their borrowing limit up to 4.5x-5x income for strong applications. 
 You will need to be able to show your bank that you are able to comfortably meet your monthly mortgage repayments if granted an exception.
 Generally, the later it is in the year the more difficult it is to acquire an exception as banks begin to use up their yearly allowance.
 Try the Lively in-app calculator to help determine if you might be eligible for an exception and discuss your situation with any lenders or brokers you approach. 
 

### How are bonuses and commission factored into my borrowing limit?

What banks consider your *variable income* are things like commission, bonuses and overtime pay. Depending on the lender,
 they will factor in 50% - 100% of this income by taking the average over the past 2 - 3 years. The longer you have been in the job,
 the more data they have and the more willing they are to take variable income into consideration.
