# Help To Buy Scheme

The Help To Buy Scheme is the most popular support for buyers. It helps first time buyers applying for a mortgage to purchase a newly built home or to build their own first home. 
 Buyers may claim a refund of their income tax paid over the previous 4 years. The maximum refund available until the end of 2025 is €30,000.
 
### How do I calculate how much I am eligible for?

You may claim up to 10% of the value of the property not exceeding €30,000. The maximum refund you can claim is also limited to the amount of income tax 
 you have paid over the past 4 years. 
 

### What are the criteria?

* The home must be a new build.
* The home must be valued at no more than €500,000.
* The mortgage needs to be at least 70% of the value of the property.
* The property must be your primary residence for 5 years from the date that it is habitable.
* Your tax needs to be in order for the previous 4 years. This may involve submitting end of year tax statements for previous years
 and rectifying any over or under payments.


### How do I apply?

# Vacant Property Grant

The *Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant* is a grant that helps homeowners   transform vacant properties into livable homes. The property must be vacant for at least two years. Grants are available for up to €50,000, or €70,000 for structurally unsound properties. You will need to provide quotations from independent professionals in order to avail of the grant. Applications are made to and assessed by local county and city councils. 

Importantly you do not need to own the property before you apply, proof of engagement with the seller is sufficient.

# First Home Scheme

The First Home Scheme is a shared equity scheme whereby the government will help you purchase a home and take an equity stake in the home. It is intended for buyers who are unable to afford a home despite availing of their maximum mortgage amount. You can use it to cover up to 30% of the purchase cost (or 20% if used alongside the *Help To Buy Scheme*). The scheme is available for new homes, self-builds or to purchase a home if your landlord is selling it. 

### Example Scenario

Take a couple earning a total of €60k with a €35k deposit hoping to purchase a property worth €350k. Under borrowing rules they can only afford a mortgage of €240k, the mortgage with their deposit leaves a gap of €75k which they can cover using the First Home Scheme.
