The Help To Buy Scheme helps first time buyers applying for a mortgage to purchase a newly built home or to build their own first home. 
 Buyers may claim a refund of their income tax paid over the previous 4 years. The maximum refund available until the end of 2022 is €30,000.
 


### How do I calculate how much I am eligible for?


You may claim up to 10% of the value of the property not exceeding €30,000. The maximum refund you can claim is also limited to the amount of income tax 
 you have paid over the past 4 years. 
 


### What are the criteria?


* The home must be a new build.
* The home must be valued at no more than €500,000.
* The mortgage needs to be at least 70% of the value of the property.
* The property must be your primary residence for 5 years from the date that it is habitable.
* Your tax needs to be in order for the previous 4 years. This may involve submitting P21 Balancing Statements for previous years
 and rectifying any tax over or under payments.
