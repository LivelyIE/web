The type of solicitor you will need to take care of the legalities of buying a home is known as a *Conveyancing* solicitor. 
 You should begin searching for one as soon as you start looking for a home.
 
These days you do not need to meet with your solicitor in person when buying a home or signing contracts so you don't necessarily need to find one based in your local area unless you prefer to meet with them in person. The most important thing you should look for in a solicitor is their reputation as a good one will give you peace of mind and keep the sale moving at a reasonable pace.

### Solicitor Fees Explained

* **Professional Fee** - This is usually the name of the 
 fee paid to your conveyancer for their services. They are required to charge VAT of 23% so check whether or not your quote includes this tax when comparing prices.
 
* **Outlays** - These are fixed costs that solicitors must pay to complete your home purchase such as registering your name with government bodies that track property ownership as well as costs like posting physical documents where required. These will typically come to close to â‚¬1,100.

* **Stamp Duty** - This is a government tax and is fixed regardless of your solicitor choice. 

You generally won't incur any costs until you are sale agreed on a property.
 If the sale falls through, you may still need to pay your solicitor for their services and any fees they paid on your behalf. 
 This will depend on how far through the process you are.
 

### How long does the process take once I am sale agreed?

The conveyancing process generally takes 6-8 weeks, although it's not uncommon to experience delays.
