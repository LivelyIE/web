If your offer is accepted by the seller their estate agent will let you know. Congratulations, you are now *Sale Agreed*. 
 Being sale agreed is simply a verbal agreement between you and the seller, either party can still pull out of the sale at this point.
 
You should immediately let your solicitor and your lender or mortgage broker know that you are sale agreed. Provide them with the 
 sale price and address of the property. Continue with the steps outlined in the app to keep the process on track and ensure
 you can drawdown on your loan without any hiccups.

Keep in mind that after going sale agreed many people experience hiccups and delays with the purchasing process. Stay on top of what you can control and try not to worry about anything you can't influence.
 

### What is a mortgage drawdown?

Drawdown is simply the act of borrowing the funds required to purchase your property. 
 The drawdown will happen the day you are completing the purchase of your home. 
 The funds from the bank will be transferred to your solicitor who will send them to the seller. 


### Can you spend your savings after going Sale Agreed?

A lender will check your finances again before you drawdown so you shouldn't be reckless with your 
 money just because you are sale agreed. Sensible uses of your savings like furniture for your new
 home are fine.
