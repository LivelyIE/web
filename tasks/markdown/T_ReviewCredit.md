In Ireland there is no such thing as a "Credit Score" however you can be denied a mortgage over a negative credit history and there will be a record of it if you were unable to make a previous loan payment. 


## Checking Your Credit Report

Your lender will run a credit check against the *Central Credit Register* to see if you have had any credit issues in the past. Typically the report goes back five years. Thankfully, if you have any doubts about your history you can request a copy of your own credit report from [their website](https://www.centralcreditregister.ie/). 

If you have a past credit issue then it is advisable to talk to a mortgage broker. Some lenders are more lenient than others and a broker will help you understand your options. 


## Credit Checks After Living Abroad

If you have been living outside Ireland in the previous five years you will likely be required to retrieve a credit report from that country as well.
