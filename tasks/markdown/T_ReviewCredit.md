In Ireland there is no such thing as a "Credit Score" however you can be denied a mortgage over a negative credit history and there will be a record of it if you were unable to make a previous loan payment. 


## Checking Your Credit Report

Your lender will run a credit check against the *Central Credit Register* to see if you have had any credit issues in the past. You can request a copy of your own credit report from [the Central Credit Register website](https://www.centralcreditregister.ie/). 

There is no downside to checking your report though it is not necessary if you are comfortable with your credit history. The report contains:

* Active loans.
* Repaid debt and missed payments from the past five years.
* Outstanding debt from any period. Outstanding debt may never disappear from this report until it is settled and a lender will not grant you a mortgage until that point.  

If you have a past credit issue then it is advisable to talk to a mortgage broker. Some lenders are more lenient than others and a broker will help you understand your options or how long you will need to wait before you can apply.  


## Credit Checks After Living Abroad

If you have been living outside Ireland in the previous five years you will likely be required to retrieve a credit report from that country as well. It is best to request this before moving home if possible as it can be challenging to retrieve afterwards for some countries.
