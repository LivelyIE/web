    <p>There are a few useful resources you can use to check on the history of homes you're viewing.</p>
    <h3>Property Price Register</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.propertypriceregister.ie">Property Price Register</a> has the date and price of any 
        home purchased since January 1st 2010. If a property on the market was sold recently, it may tell you if it was bought
        to be renovated and sold. Or in rare cases, it suggests that the current owners aren't happy with their purchase.

    <h3>Planning Application Viewer</h3>
    <p><a href="https://myplan.ie">myplan.ie</a> is a public database of planning applications. It can show you a history of both approved 
        and rejected applications. You can use it to see if a modification to a home is legal, or if plans for an extension you were 
        considering has been rejected in the past.
    </p>
    <h3>Search Engines</h3>
    <p>A great way to find out about homes your eyeing up is simply to type the address into a search engine! You may find some old listings. 
        Something to look out for is a property that has been on the market for a long period of time, which may imply that a sale has recently fallen through. 
        While this isn't necessarily a bad thing and can happen for perfectly normal reasons, like some last minute cold feet, it could mean that another bidder found
        a problem.
