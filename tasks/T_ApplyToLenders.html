    <p>Once you have your documents ready, it's time to start reaching out to lenders! If you're not working with a broker, you can call or email
        banks to kick off the process, they will be happy to hear from you.

    <h2>Approval in Principle</h2>
    <p>When you submit your initial financial information to a lender, they will grant you <i>Approval in Principle</i>. Approval in principle is an estimate of
        how much a lender may grant you if your financial circumstances don't change. When finalising your mortgage, they will carry out more thorough
        checks and the amount you can borrow may ultimately be different.
    </p>

    <p>It's a good idea to begin get approval in principle from more than one lender in case your application isn't successful when you are closing out the mortgage application. 
        If a mortgage application falls through after you are sale agreed on a property, having another lender on standby may prevent you from missing out on a home.
    </p>

    <p>Many estate agents will request a copy of your approval in principle when you bid on a property. The approval is generally valid for 6 months.</p>
