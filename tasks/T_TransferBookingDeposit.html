    <p>Once your offer is accepted by the estate agent, the home is considered to be at the <i>Sale Agreed</i> stage. 
        You will need to transfer a <i>Booking Deposit</i> to the estate agent, a sum of money that signals to all parties that you intend to proceed
        with the purchase the property. 
        The size of the booking deposit is typically a percentage of the sale price, no more than 10%, or a fixed amount.

    <p>Booking deposits are fully refundable if you decide not to go through with the sale for <b>any</b> reason.</p>
