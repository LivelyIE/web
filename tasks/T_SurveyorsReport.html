    <p>A surveyors report, sometimes called an engineer's report, is an impartial review on the condition of a property.
        If purchasing a second hand home, it is highly recommended that you hire a professional surveyor to evaluate the property before you sign the contracts.
    </p>
    <p>A surveyor will be looking closely for signs of defects with the home, such as dampness or damaged roofing. 
    </p>

    <h4>What if they find a problem?</h4>
    <p>All homes require maintenance, and it is common for these reports to note minor concerns that shouldn't put you off your purchase. 
        In the case where a serious issue is uncovered, you have a few options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proceed with the sale, accepting that you will need to address the problem.</li>
        <li>Renegotiate the purchase price to factor in the cost of repair work.</li>
        <li>Ask the current owners to take steps to resolve the problem.</li>
        <li>If the issue is too much to overcome, you may pull out of the sale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Home Snag Lists</h4>
    <p>For new homes, you likely won't need a full structural report. Instead, you will compile a <i>Snag List</i> which will consist of a list of defects that need 
        to be addressed by the builders of the property before the sale is finalised. Items in a snag list can be anything from a broken plug socket to an uneven surface.
        You can complete a snag list yourself, though it is wise to hire a professional.
