    <p>Before you bid on a home you should determine your bidding strategy.</p>

    <h4>Making the First Bid</h4>
    <p>In busy markets, many properties will sell above the asking price. If you feel like there will be a lot of interest in a home you are considering,
        an initial offer at or above the asking price can be a deterrent to other buyers. In quieter markets, the final price can be lower than the asking price
        and starting low is a viable option. 
    </p>

    <h4>Bidding Against Others</h4>
    <p>Typically estate agents accept bids in increments no smaller than â‚¬1,000. When bidding against potential buyers, sometimes increasing the bid by a few 
        thousand Euro can send strong signal to other buyers and deter them from outbidding you.
    </p>

    <h4>Set a Limit</h4>
    <p>It's easy to get caught up in a bidding war, and after bidding "once more" too many times you can end up winning with a price you aren't comfortable with.
        Before your first bid, decide what your maximum price is for the property.
    </p>

    <h4>Proof of Funds</h4>
    <p>As part of the bidding process, some estate agents will ask for proof that a bank has provided you with mortgage approval in principle. 
        If you don't want to show your hand by giving the estate agent the amount you were approved for, you can ask your lender to write a statement indicating 
        that they intend to lend you the bid amount.
